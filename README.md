# Battlefield V player lister
#### This repo uses [xx4-bfv-aimassist](https://github.com/exex4/xx4-bfv-aimassist) as its core!
#### What is its purpose?:
 - ##### List all players in the game with quick links to bfvhackers.com
#### Install:
1. ##### [bfv-playerlist](https://github.com/perheld/bfv-playerlist)
2. ##### [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add to path

#### But why?!
I got sick and tired of always discovering that cheaters are in the game when its nearing the end in firestorm.

#### Future:
 - Automatically check players using the bfvhackers API and get green/red text if there are bad players

#### What does it look like?

#### Warning
I dont take any responsibility for your account being banned by using this. Since at its core its about reading memory from the BFV process and that is the same procedures at aimbots use fairplay might think this is bad. I dont know. I have been using this for a while and will probably continue in doing so.
